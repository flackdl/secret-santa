## Secret Santa app

This is a simple app that randomly assigns secret santa recipipients and can email the results to each participant.  It will follow exclusion rules, i.e couples can't get assigned each other.

I built this to test out [vue.js] (https://vuejs.org).  It's [hosted] (http://sloppy-santa.herokuapp.com) on heroku for free and is using [sendgrid] (http://sendgrid.com) for the email service.
